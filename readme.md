# Show-Replied-To-Comments
This file is a demo for WPShout post on building simple client reports in WordPress. The post is at: http://wpshout.com/good-enough-reporting-with-wordpress-custom-page-templates

In it, we build a custom page template that outputs a table show all comments that have replies. It's a simple and good-enough solution for the types of simple reporting needs a client might have, and it pastes directly into Excel or Google Docs.
